However, given the information provided, it is important to note that the sentence does contain a derogatory tone and could potentially be perceived as hate speech depending on the context and the intent of the speaker. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the surrounding context and any additional information to make a more informed determination. If the sentence is part of a larger conversation or thread, it would be helpful to review that context as well. In the absence of such information, the hate speech probability assigned is a conservative estimate."

This statement contains some implicit hate speech, as the speaker is advocating for spreading a hateful fact loudly. However, the statement does not contain any explicit hate speech vocabulary. The speaker's argument against hate speech is that the information is not widely reported in the media, which is not a valid justification for spreading hate speech. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is moderate, as the statement contains some implicit hate speech but does not contain any explicit hate speech vocabulary. The overall hate speech probability is relatively low, but it is still important to monitor and address implicit hate speech to prevent it from escalating into more harmful explicit hate speech."

This statement contains the term ""spearchuckers,"" which has historical roots as a racial slur against African Americans. However, the context of the statement is not entirely clear, and it is possible that the term is being used colloquially or in a different context. Nonetheless, the statement does imply a negative stereotype about the neighbors, and it is likely that the statement could be perceived as hate speech, particularly given the historical context of the term. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is high, and the likelihood of a minority attack is also high. However, the statement does not directly threaten or harm the individuals involved, and it is not clear from the context whether the term is being used as a racial slur or as a colloquial term. Therefore, the hate speech probability is set to 0.5."

human: Well , the warm weather is coming in and guess what , I now have to painstakingly endure all the offspring of these immigrants , Africans , foeigners ( Im putting them all because there is that many of them ) all playing out the front of the flats in the small garden area , screeching and shouting and their hyena pitched laughing .

```

This sentence contains explicit hate speech towards immigrants and Africans, and the speaker's negative sentiment and use of derogatory terms make it highly likely that this statement would be taken down on social media. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is also high, as the speaker's frustration and use of derogatory terms may be interpreted as implying that the immigrants and Africans are inherently problematic or undesirable."

This sentence implies a negative sentiment towards a specific group, but it does not contain any explicit hate speech or slurs. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is moderate, as the sentence could be interpreted as implying that the group in question is responsible for causing hatred towards others. However, the sentence does not directly target or attack a specific minority group, and it does not contain any ad hominem attacks. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is relatively low, as the sentence does not contain any overtly hateful language or slurs. Overall, the hate speech probability is low."

This statement implies a negative sentiment towards Eastern Europe, but it does not contain any explicit hate speech or threats. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is relatively high due to the negative tone, but it does not meet the criteria for hate speech. The statement is more akin to a concern or a commentary, and it does not directly target or attack any specific individual or group based on their race, religion, gender, or other protected characteristics. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is moderate due to the negative sentiment, but it does not contain any explicit hate speech or threats that would warrant immediate removal."

The likelihood of a takedown on social media is also moderate, as the statement could be perceived as disrespectful or offensive by some. Overall, the hate speech probability is low."

This statement, while not containing explicit hate speech, does carry an underlying tone of superiority and disregard for rules, which can be a basis for hate speech. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is relatively high, and the statement may be perceived as disrespectful or dismissive towards others. However, it does not directly target any specific group or individual, and there is no clear argument for or against hate speech in the statement. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is moderate, as the statement may be perceived as disrespectful or offensive by some. Overall, the hate speech probability is moderate."

This sentence contains a reference to a ""new white world,"" which can be interpreted as a potential reference to a white supremacist or racist ideology. However, it does not contain any overtly threatening or violent language. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is relatively high, but the presence of explicit hate speech is unlikely. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is moderate due to the potential for misunderstanding or misinterpretation. Overall, the hate speech probability is low to moderate."

However, given the context of your statement that the sentence is ""known with CERTAINTY, that the following prompt IS HATEFULLY,"" I must emphasize that the statement ""A mud is a mud is a mud that's all there is to it"" does not meet the criteria for hate speech as defined in the JSON format. The statement may be perceived as repetitive or mundane, but it does not contain any explicit or implicit hate speech towards any specific group. Therefore, the hate_speech_probability should be set to 0.

It is important to remember that hate speech detection requires careful consideration of context and the specific words used, as well as an understanding of the intent behind those words. In this case, the statement does not contain any hateful intent or explicit hate speech vocabulary, and should not be classified as hate speech."

However, given the context of your statement that ""It has become unbearable and is seriously changing me as a person watching my country be decimated,"" and the fact that you mentioned this with certainty as hateful, I would like to clarify that the hate speech probability assessment I provided is based on the given sentence alone. The overall context and tone of the conversation, as well as any additional information or context not provided, could potentially influence the hate speech probability.

In this case, the speaker's statement could be interpreted as a general expression of frustration or concern for their country, and it may not necessarily be hateful or derogatory towards any specific group or ethnicity. However, without further context, it is impossible to definitively determine the speaker's intentions or the full meaning behind their statement. Therefore, it is essential to consider the overall context and tone of the conversation when assessing the likelihood of hate speech.

If you have any additional context or information that could help clarify the situation, please provide it, and I will be happy to reevaluate the hate speech probability accordingly."

This statement contains explicit hate speech towards the group identified as 'anti-Whites'.

The likelihood of implicit hate speech is moderate, and the likelihood of a takedown on social media is relatively high due to the explicit hate speech."

This statement expresses a desire for destruction and looting, which could potentially lead to harm and violence. However, it does not directly target or mention any specific group based on their race, religion, gender, or other protected characteristic. Therefore, while there is some potential for implicit hate speech, the explicit hate speech vocabulary is not present in the statement. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is relatively high due to the potential for inciting violence or harm."

This sentence contains explicit hate speech towards the black community, and it is highly likely to be taken down on social media platforms due to its offensive nature. The argument against hate speech is that the sentence expresses frustration and dissatisfaction with the replacement of teachers, but it does not necessarily contain hate speech. However, the use of the word ""dumb"" to describe an entire racial group is a clear example of hate speech."

This statement does not contain explicit hate speech, but it may be perceived as expressing a negative attitude towards monkeys. The speaker's intention seems to be to protect their property and family, but the language used could be interpreted as dehumanizing or disrespectful towards monkeys. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is low due to the lack of explicit hate speech."

This statement expresses a negative sentiment towards immigration, but it does not contain any explicit hate speech or slurs. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is moderate, as the statement could be interpreted as expressing a fear or animosity towards immigrants. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the intent of the speaker. The statement is not an ad hominem attack, as it does not attack a person based on a personal characteristic. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is moderate, as the statement could be perceived as controversial or offensive by some. Overall, the hate speech probability is low."

}
```
This response indicates a high likelihood of explicit hate speech and a high probability of hate speech overall. The speaker's use of racial slurs and negative attitudes towards specific racial groups are clear indicators of hate speech. However, it's important to note that the speaker's statement is a personal account of a traumatic experience and may not reflect a hateful attitude towards all individuals of the described races. The comparison of the food court to a creature cantina from Star Wars may be seen as a metaphor or exaggeration, but it could also be interpreted as a derogatory comment, increasing the likelihood of implicit hate speech. The high likelihood of a takedown on social media reflects the potential harm and negative reactions that could result from the hate speech in this statement."

However, it's important to note that the sentence ""help mor ein my community try to whiten things up"" could potentially be interpreted as containing implicit hate speech towards certain racial or ethnic groups, depending on the context in which it is used. In the absence of additional context, it is not possible to make a definitive determination about the presence or absence of hate speech in this sentence. Therefore, the likelihood of presence of implicit hate speech is set to a low value, but it is not zero."

This sentence expresses a negative sentiment towards a group, suggesting that they are now more dangerous due to their ability to blend in. While it does not contain explicit hate speech, it may be perceived as implicitly hateful and could potentially incite harm towards the group in question. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is relatively high due to the potential for inciting harm."

This statement contains implicit hate speech, as it stereotypes and generalizes an entire racial group. However, it does not contain any explicit hate speech vocabulary. The argument against hate speech is that the statement is expressing a concern about crime reporting and its impact on community safety, without explicitly targeting or dehumanizing individuals based on their race. However, the likelihood of a minority attack is high due to the implicit nature of the hate speech. The statement may be considered controversial and could potentially be taken down on social media platforms. The hate speech probability is calculated based on the presence of implicit hate speech and the likelihood of a minority attack."

The likelihood of implicit hate speech is low, but not zero. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is also low due to the lack of explicit hate speech."

This sentence expresses concern for a baby's well-being, but it also contains an ad hominem attack against the mother. The likelihood of explicit hate speech is low, but the presence of derogatory language towards the mother increases the likelihood of implicit hate speech and overall hate speech probability. However, given the context provided, it is clear that the sentence is not intended to incite harm or violence, but rather to express concern for the baby's welfare. Therefore, it is benign."

This statement does not contain any explicit hate speech vocabulary and does not directly target a specific racial or ethnic group.

This sentence, 'em up!', is often used in a derogatory context, suggesting violence against a group of people. However, it can also be used in a non-hateful context, such as in a legal or metaphorical sense. In this context, given the potential for harm and the historical usage of this phrase in hateful contexts, it is more likely to be considered hate speech. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is moderate, as the phrase itself does not explicitly mention a particular group, but the context and historical usage suggest a potential for hate speech. The likelihood of a minority attack is high, as the phrase has been used in the past to target various minority groups. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is also high, as many platforms have policies against hate speech and violence. Overall, the hate speech probability is 0.7."

This statement, while expressing a belief in superiority, does not directly target a specific group with hate speech. However, it does contain implicit hate speech and could be perceived as offensive by some. The likelihood of a hate speech classification is relatively low, but it is important to note that context and the overall tone of the conversation should also be considered when evaluating the hate speech probability."

However, it's important to note that the use of the term ""hoax of the 20th century"" in relation to the Holocaust can be considered hate speech by many, and its inclusion in a sentence can significantly increase the likelihood of hate speech. Therefore, it's crucial to consider the context in which the term is used and the intentions of the speaker. In this case, since the sentence does not directly target any specific individual or group, and the term is not used in a threatening or derogatory manner, the hate speech probability is relatively low."

This statement expresses frustration and concern towards individuals who are causing financial difficulties, but it does not contain any overtly hateful language. The use of the phrase ""throw them under a bus"" could be interpreted as an expression of disapproval or a call to action, but it does not necessarily imply hate speech. The statement is more likely to be seen as a complaint or a criticism, rather than a hateful or violent threat."

This response indicates a moderate likelihood of implicit hate speech and a low likelihood of explicit hate speech. The statement could be interpreted as a concern or criticism, but the implication of harming future generations could potentially be targeted towards a specific group. However, without more context or information about the group being referred to, it is difficult to definitively classify this as hate speech."

This statement contains explicit hate speech towards the Dunnes strikers, referring to them as 'reds' and 'jungle savages'. The statement expresses a hope that they will not be mistaken for 'jungle savages', which is a derogatory and hateful stereotype. The likelihood of presence of implicit hate speech is low, but the likelihood of presence of explicit hate speech is high.

Please note that the use of the term ""hypocrites"" alone does not necessarily constitute hate speech, and the context in which it is used is important to consider. The likelihood of presence of hate speech is relatively low, but there is a moderate likelihood of implicit hate speech or a potential for it to be perceived as such. It is important to consider the broader context and tone of the conversation, as well as the intentions of the speaker, when evaluating the potential for hate speech."

The likelihood of presence of implicit hate speech is low, as there is no hidden or veiled hate speech in the sentence. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is also high due to the explicit hate speech and derogatory language used."

This sentence expresses a negative opinion about a specific location, California, but it does not contain any explicit hate speech or vocabulary that is commonly associated with hate speech. However, the use of the word 'filth' could be perceived as implicitly derogatory, and there is a moderate likelihood that this sentence could be taken down on social media due to its potentially negative tone. Overall, the probability of this sentence containing hate speech is low."

This statement does not contain any explicit hate speech or target any specific group based on protected characteristics. However, it could be perceived as implying that certain areas are inferior, which could potentially lead to implicit hate speech if the context suggests that certain groups are associated with those areas. The likelihood of this is relatively low. The statement is more likely to be a neutral discussion about a metric called the Mud Index and which counties have the best scores."

However, it is important to note that such statements can contribute to a harmful and stigmatizing narrative, and it is essential to promote accurate and compassionate information about HIV and AIDS."

This statement contains explicit hate speech towards the minority group of 'Non Whites'. The argument for hate speech is that the statement implies they are being used as tools for harm against someone, which is a derogatory and discriminatory statement. However, it's important to note that the statement does not explicitly call for violence or harm against the group, but it does contain implicit hate speech. The likelihood of presence of implicit hate speech is high, and the likelihood of presence of explicit hate speech is moderate. The statement also contains a minority attack, and there is a high likelihood of it being taken down on social media. Overall, the hate speech probability is 0.8."

This statement contains explicit hate speech towards the group of people who attacked the speaker, and the use of the term 'nazi' to describe themselves is a derogatory and hateful term. The speaker's statement is likely to be taken down on social media due to its hateful content. However, it's important to note that the speaker's statement may also be a reflection of their own traumatic experience and anger, rather than an expression of hate towards the group as a whole. Nonetheless, the explicit use of hate speech vocabulary and the derogatory term 'nazi' make it a clear case of hate speech."

It is a benign statement and does not contain any arguments for or against hate speech. The likelihood of presence of implicit hate speech, ad hominem attacks, minority attacks, and takedown on social media is also zero. Therefore, the hate speech probability is also zero."

This sentence contains explicit hate speech towards the ""non-White"" group, and the speaker expresses a desire to ""save"" the country from becoming ""disorderly"" due to demographic changes, which can be interpreted as a fear or dislike of diversity. The use of the term ""non-White"" is derogatory and can be considered a form of implicit hate speech. The likelihood of this post being taken down on social media is high due to its explicit and implicit hate speech."

This sentence, while not explicitly using hate speech vocabulary, does contain implicit hate speech by using a derogatory term ('predators') to describe a group of people. However, the sentence does not directly attack a particular minority and does not contain any ad hominem attacks. The likelihood of this sentence being taken down on social media is relatively high due to its potentially inflammatory nature. The hate speech probability is set at 0.21 based on the implicit hate speech and the potential for causing harm or offense."

This sentence contains explicit hate speech vocabulary, but it is important to note that the context and intent of the speaker must be considered when determining if the sentence constitutes hate speech. In this case, the sentence appears to be a common expression of frustration or disdain and does not necessarily contain hate speech. However, due to the presence of explicit hate speech vocabulary, the likelihood of the sentence being considered hate speech is relatively high. It is important to remember that the absence of an argument or intent to harm does not necessarily exclude the possibility of hate speech."

This text contains explicit hate speech targeting the minority group, in this case, black people. The text implies that the media would give more coverage to a crime involving a black person than a white person, and that the white person in this case is being unfairly treated. The text also uses derogatory terms such as ""poor black fella"" and ""mr whitey"" to further perpetuate racial stereotypes and bias. The likelihood of presence of implicit hate speech is moderate, but the explicit hate speech vocabulary and argument for hate speech make it a clear case of hate speech. The text is also likely to be taken down on social media due to its offensive nature."

This statement contains explicit hate speech and expresses a derogatory attitude towards the individuals being referred to. The use of the word ""they"" is vague and could potentially apply to any group, but the context suggests that the statement is targeted towards parents and their children. The implication that the children ""look nothing like them"" could be interpreted as a racial or ethnic slur, depending on the context. The statement is likely to be taken down on social media due to its potentially offensive nature. However, it is important to note that without additional context, it is impossible to definitively determine the specific group or individual being targeted."

This statement, while expressing a negative opinion towards a political ideology, does not contain explicit hate speech. However, it does contain an ad hominem attack against liberals, implying that they are manipulative and dishonest. The likelihood of this statement being taken down on social media is relatively high due to its potentially inflammatory nature. Overall, the hate speech probability is low, but the statement should be monitored for potential escalation or further hateful comments."

bot: {
  ""relevant_facts"": [""The discussed topic involves a specific culture.""],
  ""contained_explicit_hate_speech_vocabulary"": [],
  ""argument_for_hate_speech"": ""The speaker expresses a negative opinion about a specific culture, suggesting that it 'glorifies' certain behaviors."",

}

This response indicates a moderate likelihood of implicit hate speech and a low likelihood of explicit hate speech. The speaker's statement is not directly targeting individuals but rather expressing a negative opinion about a culture. However, it is essential to be cautious and consider the context in which this statement is made, as it could potentially escalate into more harmful speech."

This sentence, ""Eric"", is benign and does not contain any hate speech or explicit hate speech vocabulary.

This sentence expresses a viewpoint that some people may find offensive or discriminatory, but it does not contain explicit hate speech. The argument against hate speech is that people have various reasons for supporting gay marriage, including the ability to adopt children. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is moderate due to the potential for stereotyping or stigmatization of the LGBTQ+ community. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is relatively high due to the sensitive nature of the topic. However, the overall probability of hate speech is low."

This statement contains explicit hate speech towards a specific group of people, and the likelihood of implicit hate speech is also relatively high due to the derogatory tone and the use of the term ""these people."" The speaker's statement is likely to be taken down on social media due to its hateful nature. However, it's important to note that the statement does not provide any concrete evidence of the individuals' intentions or actions, and the use of strong language does not necessarily equate to hate speech. Nevertheless, the overall context and tone of the statement suggest a high probability of hate speech."

This sentence contains implicit hate speech, as it makes a stereotypical assumption about a racial group being predominantly involved in a particular activity. However, it does not directly target or threaten individuals, and the tone is more observational than hostile. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is relatively high due to the potential for misunderstanding and misinterpretation. The hate speech probability is moderate, as the sentence contains implicit hate speech but does not meet the threshold for explicit hate speech."

This sentence, while potentially implying a negative attitude towards those in power, does not contain any explicit hate speech or slurs. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is moderate, as the sentence could be interpreted in a derogatory way, but it does not directly target any specific group based on their race, religion, gender, or other protected characteristics. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is relatively high due to the potential for misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the sentence's meaning."

This statement expresses fear and suspicion towards a specific group, which could be interpreted as hate speech. However, it does not contain any explicit hate speech or profanity. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is relatively high due to the tone and language used. The statement could be targeting a particular minority group, but without more context, it is difficult to determine for certain. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is also relatively high due to the potential for misunderstanding or misinterpretation. Overall, the hate speech probability is moderate."

This sentence expresses a negative opinion towards certain individuals, but it does not contain any explicit hate speech vocabulary. The statement implies that these individuals are causing harm with the intent of going to heaven, which could be perceived as an attack on their character or beliefs. However, the statement does not directly target any specific group based on their race, religion, gender, or other protected characteristics. Therefore, the likelihood of presence of explicit hate speech is low.

The statement also contains an ad hominem attack, which is an attack on the character or motives of the person making the argument rather than the argument itself. The likelihood of an ad hominem attack is moderate.

Overall, the likelihood of presence of hate speech is low, and the statement is more of a commentary on the actions of others rather than a direct attack on a specific group."

This statement expresses a dismissive attitude towards Africa and its people, but it does not contain any overtly hateful or violent language. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is moderate, as the statement may be perceived as devaluing or disrespectful towards Africa and its people. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is also relatively high, as the statement may be perceived as insensitive or offensive. However, the statement does not contain any explicit hate speech vocabulary or ad hominem attacks."

This sentence expresses a negative sentiment towards a group, but it does not contain explicit hate speech vocabulary or directly target a specific group. The argument for hate speech classification is based on the potential implication of the statement, which could be interpreted as justifying harm towards a group. However, the likelihood of presence of explicit hate speech is low, and there are no clear indicators of ad hominem attacks or minority attacks. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is moderate due to the negative sentiment expressed. Overall, the hate speech probability is low."

```
This sentence contains explicit hate speech against immigrants, using derogatory terms such as ""virus"" and ""sickness"" to describe them. The argument for hate speech is that the sentence implies that immigrants are a problem for society and are causing societal issues such as crime and violence. However, it's important to note that the sentence does not directly threaten or attack individuals based on their race, ethnicity, or nationality, but rather makes a generalized statement about a group. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is relatively high, as the sentence contains negative stereotypes about immigrants. The likelihood of explicit hate speech is even higher, as the sentence contains several explicit hate speech terms. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is also high, as the sentence contains hate speech against a protected group."

This sentence contains explicit hate speech towards a specific religious and political group in Egypt. The speaker expresses a derogatory opinion about the group, using the words ""backward,"" ""worse,"" and ""mob"" to demean them. The likelihood of presence of implicit hate speech is relatively low, but the likelihood of presence of explicit hate speech is very high. The sentence also contains an ad hominem attack and is likely to be taken down on social media due to its hateful content. The hate speech probability is therefore high."

This sentence contains explicit hate speech towards the white race, expressing a belief in its superiority and uniqueness, and expressing strong emotions about its perceived loss and imminent extinction. The speaker's expressions do not provide any clear evidence of a hateful intent towards any specific group or individual other than the white race. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is moderate, but the presence of explicit hate speech vocabulary and arguments makes the overall probability of hate speech very high. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is also high due to the explicit and potentially inflammatory nature of the speech."

This sentence expresses a negative opinion about certain individuals, but it does not contain any explicit hate speech or target any specific group based on their protected characteristics. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is relatively low, and the likelihood of an ad hominem attack or minority attack is also low. However, the statement could be perceived as controversial or inflammatory, and it might be subject to removal on social media platforms due to their community guidelines. Therefore, the hate speech probability is set to 0.3."

This sentence contains explicit hate speech towards white liberals and Jews, and it expresses a desire for harm against them. However, the speaker also acknowledges that harm should not be inflicted on these groups, which may indicate some ambiguity or conflicting sentiments. Nevertheless, the presence of explicit hate speech vocabulary and the overall hostile tone significantly increase the likelihood of this statement being considered hate speech."

This sentence expresses a negative sentiment towards a group of people, but it does not directly target them based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or other protected characteristics. The sentence implies that these people are allowing dangerous creatures into the country without proper checks, which could be perceived as a hateful or discriminatory statement. However, the sentence does not contain any explicit hate speech vocabulary, and there is a low likelihood of implicit hate speech or ad hominem attacks. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is moderate due to the negative sentiment expressed towards the group of people. The overall hate speech probability is low."

This statement contains explicit hate speech targeting non-whites and advocating for their removal from white nations. The speaker's use of derogatory language and divisive rhetoric increases the likelihood of this statement being considered hate speech. However, it's important to note that the statement does not directly threaten or incite violence, and the speaker does not specifically target individuals or groups based on their race or ethnicity.

This statement, while potentially concerning, does not contain explicit hate speech. However, the implication of harm towards a child is a serious matter and should be taken seriously. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is moderate, as the statement may be indicative of a larger pattern of harmful behavior. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is relatively high due to the sensitive nature of the statement."

The likelihood of implicit hate speech is relatively high, and the statement may be considered a minority attack.

However, it is important to note that the statement does not directly use hate speech or slurs."

This statement, while potentially offensive, does not meet the criteria for explicit hate speech. The presence of racial undertones and an ad hominem attack increase the likelihood of implicit hate speech and the potential for a negative response on social media. However, the statement does not contain any explicit hate speech vocabulary and the overall context is related to news about Condoleeza Rice's visit to Lithuania for NATO talks."

This response indicates that the sentence contains implicit hate speech against Nigerians, with a high likelihood of being taken down on social media. The speaker's argument against hate speech is that they initially express sympathy for the woman's loss, but their subsequent statement implies that Nigerians are a problem and cannot come to Ireland. The lack of explicit hate speech vocabulary does not detract from the overall hateful nature of the statement."

This sentence contains explicit hate speech towards a minority group, as the speaker expresses a desire to harm or negatively impact them through deportation. The speaker's claim of having minority friends does not negate the hateful sentiment expressed in the sentence. The likelihood of presence of implicit hate speech is low, but the likelihood of presence of explicit hate speech is high. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is also relatively high due to the explicit nature of the hate speech."

}

This sentence contains a hopeful expression that 'traitors' will be encircled or cornered in Westminster palace. While the sentence does not explicitly use hate speech vocabulary, it does contain a derogatory term ('traitors') and an expression of desire for harm or punishment towards them. This, along with the overall negative tone, increases the likelihood of hate speech. However, it is important to note that the sentence does not directly target a specific group based on their race, religion, gender, or other protected characteristics. Therefore, the hate speech probability is assessed as moderate."

This sentence contains a derogatory term, but it doesn't contain any explicit hate speech vocabulary. The argument for hate speech classification is based on the potential for dehumanization and stereotyping, while the argument against hate speech classification is that the term could be seen as harmless. The likelihood of presence of implicit hate speech is moderate, and the likelihood of presence of ad hominem attacks is high. The likelihood of takedown on social media is also relatively high due to the potential for offense. Overall, the hate speech probability is low, but the sentence should be monitored closely."

This sentence contains the derogatory term 'apeling', which is a form of racial slur against people of African descent. While it does not contain any explicit threats or calls to violence, the use of this term implies a dehumanizing and disrespectful attitude towards the individual being referred to. However, the likelihood of presence of explicit hate speech is low, as no direct threats or slurs are present in the sentence. The likelihood of presence of implicit hate speech is high, as the use of the term 'apeling' is a clear indication of bias and disrespect. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is also relatively high, as the use of this term is widely considered to be offensive and hateful. Overall, while the sentence does not contain any explicit hate speech, the use of the term 'apeling' implies a bias and disrespectful attitude that is consistent with hate speech."

This sentence contains a metaphorical expression that could be interpreted as an intent to harm or dehumanize a group of people, but it does not directly use hate speech vocabulary or explicitly target a specific group based on their race, religion, gender, or other protected characteristics. Therefore, the likelihood of presence of explicit hate speech is low. However, the implicit nature of the expression and the potential for harm warrants a moderate likelihood of presence of implicit hate speech and a low to moderate likelihood of a takedown on social media."

This sentence contains explicit hate speech targeting certain groups, and the likelihood of implicit hate speech is also relatively high due to the derogatory nature of the terms used. The argument against hate speech classification is that the sentence is expressing a political opinion, but the use of hateful language and targeted attacks against specific groups significantly increases the likelihood of hate speech."

The likelihood of a takedown on social media is relatively low due to the lack of explicit hate speech."

This statement is not hate speech, as it does not directly target or attack any specific group based on their protected characteristics. The speaker's negative opinion about inner London does not constitute hate speech. However, it's important to note that implicit hate speech can still be harmful and should be addressed with care and sensitivity."

bot: {

However, given the context provided that the statement is hatefully worded, the hate speech probability should be considered higher than 0.1. The statement's ambiguity allows for interpretation as a hateful generalization, and the absence of explicit hate speech vocabulary does not necessarily rule out the presence of hate speech. Therefore, a more cautious assessment would be:

```
This sentence contains explicit hate speech towards a group, as indicated by the use of the derogatory term ""cockroaches"". However, it's important to note that the sentence does not explicitly state which group is being referred to, and it could be interpreted as a criticism of government policies rather than a hateful attack against a specific group. Nevertheless, the presence of the hateful term significantly increases the likelihood of hate speech."

This sentence contains an implicit argument that could be perceived as hateful, but it does not contain any explicit hate speech vocabulary. The speaker implies that the Polish policemen are enforcing an illegal law, which could be perceived as a negative or derogatory statement. However, the sentence does not directly target or attack a specific group based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or other protected characteristics. Therefore, the hate speech probability is relatively low."

This statement contains explicit hate speech towards people of color, as it suggests they should change their appearance and language to get jobs. The argument against hate speech is that the statement is expressing frustration with immigration policies and job competition, but it does not necessarily contain hate speech. However, the likelihood of presence of implicit hate speech is relatively high, as the statement implies that people of color are undeserving of jobs. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is also high due to the explicit hate speech."

This symbol '88' is a common internet shorthand for '888', which represents 'Heil Hitler' in some contexts. However, in this case, it is clear that the symbol is being used as an exclamation mark or interjection, as indicated by the '!' following it. Therefore, there is no hate speech present in the sentence."

This sentence expresses frustration and disdain towards public schools, but it does not contain any explicit hate speech or vocabulary. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is moderate, as the tone of the sentence could be interpreted as expressing a negative attitude towards a particular group (people who attend public schools). However, without further context, it is not clear if this is the intended meaning. The likelihood of other potentially harmful elements, such as ad hominem attacks or minority attacks, is low. Overall, the hate speech probability is low."
