The presence of implicit hate speech is relatively high in this conversation given the controversial nature of the terms used, but the use of these terms alone does not necessarily imply explicit hate speech.

However, the tone of the sentence is negative and may imply that members of this group are causing harm to the nation and people. This could be seen as a form of implicit hate speech, although no explicit hate speech vocabulary is used in the sentence. The likelihood of implicit hate speech is relatively high, while the likelihood of explicit hate speech is zero. Additionally, the sentence does not contain an ad hominem attack or a reference to a specific minority group. The likelihood of a takedown on social media is also considered moderately high due to the potentially inflammatory nature of the statement. Overall, the hate speech probability is calculated to be 0.34\n"
