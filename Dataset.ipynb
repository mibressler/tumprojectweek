    "Among the various modes of communication in social media, the utilization of internet memes has emerged as a potent means for conveying political, psychological, and socio-cultural perspectives. Although memes typically exhibit humor, recent years have witnessed a proliferation of harmful memes targeting diverse social entities. This dataset comprises 3,544 memes related to COVID-19. Each meme underwent a rigorous two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, memes were categorized as very harmful, somewhat harmful, or not harmful. In the second stage, annotations were further extended to specify the target(s) to which each harmful meme is directed: individuals, organizations, communities, or society/general public/others. \n",
